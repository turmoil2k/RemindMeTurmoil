# RemindMeTurmoil
Reminder program made for fun for myself to remind myself about stuff
and for the homies that need it, doing this for fun/learning C++ more
will try to make it easy to change via txt editing most likely.

- Made with C++ & SFML.
- IDE is 2019 VS.
(repo is ignoring SFML, but if you link 2017 x64 sfml version it should work)
