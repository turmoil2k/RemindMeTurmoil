# RemindMeTurmoil
Reminder program made for fun for myself to remind myself about stuff
and for the homies that need it, doing this for fun/learning C++ more
will try to make it easy to change via txt editing or in window.

- Made with C++ & SFML.
- My IDE is 2019 VS if thats imporant.  
(repo is ignoring SFML, but if you link 2017 x64 sfml version it should work)
